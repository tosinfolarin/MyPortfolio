    "hobbies_explanation": "From a young age, football has been a big part of my life. I started playing at age six in a youth team, where I spent several years as captain. Over time, I was fortunate to trial with top clubs, including Charlton Athletic FC and Fulham FC, before making the step up to men’s football with Welling United FC. These experiences taught me leadership, discipline, and resilience—qualities I still carry with me today. I now continue to play at a good level, purely for the enjoyment and as a hobby outside of work."
