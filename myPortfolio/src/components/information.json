    "profile_summary": "With a BSc in Physiotherapy and 3 years’ professional practice, I learned to pair analytical precision with a deep understanding of client needs. After achieving a Distinction in my MSc in Web Development, I transitioned into the world of software development, and spent a year working as an Associate Engineer with Equals Money. I started on the Frontend team, where I worked with React.js and TypeScript to develop features for their payments platform. I then moved to the AI and Automate team, which gave me commercial backend development experience. In this role, I configured APIs, worked with AWS services like Cloudwatch, S3, and Lambda, while expanding my knowledge of AI technologies. Within this time, I have achieved an AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Certificate, this was a course I completed to deepen my understanding of cloud technology in my role. This experience has really helped me build my full-stack skills and adapt quickly to new challenges.",

    "hobbies_explanation": "From a young age, football has been a big part of my life. I started playing at age six in a youth team, where I spent several years as captain. Over time, I was fortunate to trial with top clubs, including Charlton Athletic FC and Fulham FC, before making the step up to men’s football with Welling United FC. These experiences taught me leadership, discipline, and resilience—qualities I still carry with me today. I now continue to play at a good level, purely for the enjoyment and as a hobby outside of work."
